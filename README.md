## 🧹 The Data Cleaning Problem

Have you ever encountered a dataset that looks like this?
- Inconsistent column names
- Missing values everywhere
- Weird text formatting
- Columns with mixed data types
- Outliers that skew your analysis

**ScrubPy solves ALL of these problems.**

- ✅ Summary statistics (mean, median, std, skewness)
- ✅ Text column insights (unique values, most common value, average word count)
- ✅ Outlier detection using Z-score
- ✅ Data type breakdown

### 🧹 Intelligent Cleaning Tools
- ✅ Drop/fill missing values (with preview)
- ✅ Remove duplicate rows
- ✅ Standardize text (lowercase + trim whitespace)
- ✅ Fix column names (spaces → underscores, lowercase)
- ✅ Convert column types safely (with detection)
- ✅ Remove outliers using Z-score
- ✅ Undo last cleaning operation
- ✅ Dataset backup before each cleaning step

### 📋 Comprehensive Reporting
- ✅ Generate a detailed `.txt` profiling report
- ✅ Smart suggestions included in the report
- ✅ Designed for sharing & readability

### 🎨 Interactive CLI Interface
- ✅ Built using `Rich` and `InquirerPy`
- ✅ Preview cleaning operations before applying
- ✅ Easy selection of operations
- ✅ Beautiful terminal output with progress spinners & formatting

### 📑 Smart EDA PDF Report (Phase 2)
- ✅ Generates a beautiful PDF with:
  - 📌 Column-wise plots
  - 📌 Correlation heatmap
  - 📌 Summary tables
  - 📌 Final smart cleaning suggestions
- ✅ Fully automated after user selects the option

## 🛠️ Phased Implementation Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1 – Smart Profiling (COMPLETED)
- Data inspection & profiling
- Interactive cleaning tools
- Undo & preview operations
- Exportable `.txt` report

### ✅ Phase 2 – Exploratory Analysis (COMPLETED)
- EDA report generation (PDF)
- Correlation insights & charts
- Column-wise plots
- PDF exports with smart suggestions

### 🔄 Phase 3 – AI-Powered Data Cleaning Assistant (Planned)
- ML-based missing value imputation
- Automatic column type suggestions
- Anomaly detection & pattern-based cleaning
- Recommender system for best next cleaning step

### 🧠 Phase 4 & Beyond – Context-Aware Cleaning (EXPERIMENTAL)

> The assistant reads your EDA report, understands your **domain**, and gives **semantic, column-specific cleaning suggestions.**

#### 🧪 How It Works:
1. Run ScrubPy, generate Smart EDA PDF
2. Upload the report to NLP Assistant (local or hosted)
3. Assistant:
   - Extracts column roles, domain (e.g., finance, healthcare)
   - Suggests fixes accordingly
4. You confirm or skip via CLI
5. Cleaned dataset + contextual plan exported

#### 🧬 Example: A Day in the Life of a Data Analyst

> Meet Ananya, who works at a movie studio.  
> She’s handed a messy CSV with columns like `Gross`, `Rating`, `Genre`.  
> Instead of wasting hours on formatting and cleaning...

```bash
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python -m scrubpy.cli
# → Select dataset
# → Generate EDA
# → Upload to AI Assistant
```

> ✅ “Detected domain: Movies”  
> ✅ “Convert 'Gross' from text to float?”  
> ✅ “Normalize 'Genre' labels?”  
> ✅ “Impute missing 'Rating' using median by genre?”

💡 She approves, and the dataset is now clean & ready for visualization.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scrubpy.git
cd scrubpy
pip install -r requirements.txt
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python -m scrubpy.cli
```

> 📁 Make sure your `.csv` is in the same directory!

### Phase 3: 🤖 AI-Powered Cleaning Assistant

This is where ScrubPy starts to feel like your **data science copilot**.

#### 🧠 Machine Learning-Driven Imputations
- Automatically fills missing numeric values using regression or KNN-based methods.
- For categorical columns, ScrubPy uses **mode prediction** or **frequency-based imputation**.
- Works especially well for medium-sized datasets (5K–50K rows).

#### 🕵️ Pattern Recognition
- Detects skewed distributions or suspicious values using mini anomaly detection.
- Helps uncover issues that typical profiling might miss (e.g., typos like `45.0000` vs. `45000`).

#### 🧬 Domain-Specific Strategy Recommendations
- ScrubPy starts tailoring cleaning plans based on **detected domains**:
  - **E-Commerce**: Normalize currency, unify tags/categories.
  - **Healthcare**: Validate medical units, infer measurement types.
  - **Finance**: Clean symbols, enforce numeric formats, handle negatives.

#### 📦 Output Plan as JSON
- After suggestions, a full **cleaning blueprint** (what to clean, how, and why) is shown.
- Can be saved as a `.json` file for reproducibility or audit.

#### 👩‍💻 Real-World Example

**Scenario:** You're working with a startup’s marketing data and notice missing customer ages and weird formatting in revenue columns.

```bash
python -m scrubpy.cli
# → Select your dataset
# → Choose “Smart AI Assistant”
# → Accept cleaning suggestions
```

✅ ScrubPy:
- Predicts missing ages using similar users
- Converts "$45K" to `45000`
- Flags possible encoding issues in text columns

**Total time saved:** ~45 minutes of manual inspection and pandas code  
**Confidence:** You didn’t miss anything important 🔍
