# ScrubPy – The Smartest Data Cleaner (Phase 1)

> 🚀 A simple yet powerful command-line tool to help you clean and understand your datasets faster.

## 🌊 About
ScrubPy is a lightweight CLI tool that simplifies common data cleaning tasks for students, data analysts, and researchers. It doesn't aim to be revolutionary – just helpful, smart, and fast.

Phase 1 includes the core functionality: profiling, cleaning, previewing changes, and exporting reports.
